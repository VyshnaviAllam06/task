<p><b>Some of the most significant features of Python are: 
Python is a very developer-friendly language which means that anyone and everyone can learn to code it in a couple of hours or days. 
As compared to other object-oriented programming languages like Java, C, C++, and C#, Python is one of the easiest to learn.
Being coded in C, Python by default supports the execution of code written in other programming languages such as Java, C, and C#, thus making it one of the versatile in the industry.
So I hope you all have understood what are the features of Python and what makes it special than all the other languages.
Portability is one of the major advantages of using Python.
 Python is free for all open-source languages and high-level languages which allows you to work on multiple platforms and operating systems.
You can use python on operating systems such as Linux, UNIX, Windows, Mac OS X / OS X / macOS, etc.
Python is a dynamic, high level, free open source and interpreted programming language. It supports object-oriented programming as well as procedural oriented programming.
 In Python, we don’t need to declare the type of variable because it is a dynamically typed language. For example, x = 10 Here, x can be anything such as String, int, etc.

Features in Python
There are many features in Python, some of which are discussed below as follows:

1. Easy to code: Python is a high-level programming language. Python is very easy to learn the language as compared to other languages like C, C#, Javascript, Java, etc.
 It is very easy to code in python language and anybody can learn python basics in a few hours or days. It is also a developer-friendly language. 

2. Free and Open Source: Python language is freely available at the official website and you can download it from the given download link below click on the Download Python keyword.
 Download Python Since it is open-source, this means that source code is also available to the public. So you can download it as, use it as well as share it. 

3. Object-Oriented Language: One of the key features of python is Object-Oriented programming. Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes, objects encapsulation, etc. 

4. GUI Programming Support: Graphical User interfaces can be made using a module such as PyQt5, PyQt4, wxPython, or Tk in python.
 PyQt5 is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.

5. High-Level Language: Python is a high-level language. When we write programs in python, we do not need to remember the system architecture, nor do we need to manage the memory.

6. Extensible feature: Python is a Extensible language. We can write some Python code into C or C++ language and also we can compile that code in C/C++ language.

7. Python is Portable language: Python language is also a portable language.
 For example, if we have python code for windows and if we want to run this code on other platforms such as Linux, Unix,
 and Mac then we do not need to change it, we can run this code on any platform.

8. Python is Integrated language: Python is also an Integrated language because we can easily integrated python with other languages like c, c++, etc. 

9. Interpreted Language: Python is an Interpreted Language because Python code is executed line by line at a time. like other languages C, C++, Java, etc.
 there is no need to compile python code this makes it easier to debug our code. The source code of python is converted into an immediate form called bytecode.

10. Large Standard Library Python has a large standard library that provides a rich set of modules and functions so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing.
 There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.

11. Dynamically Typed Language: Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means the type (for example- int, double, long, etc.)
 for a variable is decided at run time not in advance because of this feature we don’t need to specify the type of variable.

12. Frontend and backend development: With a new project pyscript you can run and write python codes in html with the help of 
some simple tags <py-script>, <py-env>, etc. This will help you do frontend development work in python like javascript. Backend is the strong forte of python it’s 
extensively used for this work cause of its framework like django and flask.
